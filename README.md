# Sleeeping-Teaching-Assisstant-Problem
This project deals with solving the Sleeping Teaching Assistant problem using thread synchronization. The implementation involves defining approaches to be taken for different scenarios as to how a Teaching Assistant (TA) and students interact with each other. The solution was implemented using POSIX threads, mutex-locks, and semaphores for the different scenarios. This project primarily focuses were to simulate sleeping Teaching Assistant using POSIX threads, semaphores and a First-In-First-Out queue using C programming and to implement mutex-lock and First-In-First-Out queue to avoid deadlock and starvation scenarios.
